# Probability--Card-Game--Ride-The-Bus (In-Progress)

## Rules

*Summarized using ChatGPT from [Thrillist](https://www.thrillist.com/culture/ride-the-bus-drinking-game)*

Ride the Bus is a (drinking) card game played in three phases. In the first phase, each player is dealt four cards one at a time, guessing each card’s property in sequence: red or black, higher or lower than the first card, between or outside the first two cards, and finally the suit. Wrong guesses mean drinks; right guesses in the final round let you assign drinks to others. In phase two, the dealer builds a pyramid of face-down cards (five at the base up to one at the top), flipping them row by row. If a card matches one in your hand, you can play it and assign drinks—the higher the row, the more drinks. Players try to use their cards strategically to avoid being left with too many. In the final phase, the player with the most remaining cards “rides the bus” by guessing card properties in sequence (often starting with red or black) for a set number of cards; any wrong guess forces them to drink and restart from the beginning, making it the most punishing part of the game.

This project focuses on the final phase of the game, aka "riding the bus". I use simulation to come up with the probability of correctly guessing all card properties in sequence in on the first try. 


## Compiling the Project 
### (Description is still in progress)

Work on a finite probability space generated by a uniformly shuffled standard deck of 52 cards. Let the ordered draws be $$\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4\)$$, each revealing rank and suit.

**Events and Order.**  
Define the event set
$$\[
\mathcal{E}=\{A,B,C,D\}
\]$$
with the required temporal order $$\(A \prec B \prec C \prec D\)$$. Each event is “the guess for that round is correct,” based on information available up to that round:
- \(A\): Correctly guess **Red vs. Black** for $$\(X_1\)$$.
- \(B\): Correctly guess **Higher vs. Lower** for $$\(X_2\)$$, given $$\(X_1\)$$.
- \(C\): Correctly guess **In-between vs. Outside** for $$\(X_3\)$$, given $$\(X_1,X_2\)$$.
- \(D\): Correctly guess **Suit** for $$\(X_4\)$$, given $$\(X_1,X_2,X_3\)$$.

**A Note on The Bayesian/Chain Structure.**  
Because of the ordering, the joint success probability factors by the chain rule:
$$\[
\mathbb{P}(A\cap B\cap C\cap D)
=\mathbb{P}(A)\,\mathbb{P}(B\mid A)\,\mathbb{P}(C\mid A,B)\,\mathbb{P}(D\mid A,B,C).
\]$$
Operationally, each conditional is realized by conditioning on the already revealed cards (and the strategy used at that step).

## Simulation Logic/Write-up Corresponding to the R Code

**1) Deck construction and randomization.**  
Construct ranks $$\((1{:}13)\)$$, suits $$\(\{S,H,D,C\}\)$$, and colors $$\(\{\text{black},\text{red}\}\)$$; generate a random permutation `deck_idx` to represent the shuffled deck.

**2) Event $$\(A\)$$: Red/Black (uses no prior card info).**  
- Observe color of $$\(X_1\)$$.  
- Guess uniformly at random between “red” and “black” (or any fixed strategy).  
- Record $$\( \mathbf{1}_A = \mathbb{I}\{\text{guess matches color}(X_1)\}\)$$.
- This will always have a probability of $$\( \tfrac{1}{2} \)$$ since we assume that the deck is a full, standard deck at the start.

**3) Event $$\(B\)$$: Higher/Lower (conditions on $$\(X_1\)$$).**  
- With $$\(r_1=\text{rank}(X_1)\)$$, compute counts of strictly higher and strictly lower ranks remaining.  
- Choose the **optimal** direction (“higher” if more higher cards remain; “lower” otherwise; break ties at random).  
- Reveal $$\(X_2\)$$ and record $$\( \mathbf{1}_B = \mathbb{I}\{\text{direction matches }(r_2 \gtrless r_1)\}\)$$.

**4) Event $$\(C\)$$: In-between/Outside (conditions on $$\(X_1,X_2\)$$).**  
- With $$\(r_{\min}=\min(r_1,r_2)\)$$ and $$\(r_{\max}=\max(r_1,r_2)\)$$, count remaining ranks strictly between vs. outside/equal.  
- Choose the **higher-probability** option (“between” if between-count > outside-count; else “outside”; break ties at random).  
- Reveal $$\(X_3\)$$ and record $$\( \mathbf{1}_C = \mathbb{I}\{\text{guess matches position of }r_3\}\)$$.

**5) Event $$\(D\)$$: Suit (conditions on $$\(X_1,X_2,X_3\)$$).**  
- From the 49 remaining cards, compute the remaining suit frequencies.  
- (Method permits either a uniform suit guess or a **greedy** guess of the modal remaining suit.)  
- Reveal $$\(X_4\)$$ and record $$\( \mathbf{1}_D = \mathbb{I}\{\text{guess matches suit}(X_4)\}\)$$.

**6) Estimating the joint probability.**  
Run $$\(N\)$$ number of independent simulations. For each run, compute the indicator of sequential success. I used an indicator variable because whether or not all events were guessed correctly is a true or false outcome -- Thus, suiting the defintion of the random variable. By this logic, we can preserve the binary nature of the problem when moving to calculate the joint probability of the events. This can be formulated mathematically as follows:

$$\[
\mathbf{1}_{ABCD}=\mathbf{1}_A\mathbf{1}_B\mathbf{1}_C\mathbf{1}_D\
\]$$

...and from this we can estimate...

$$\[\widehat{\mathbb{P}}(A\cap B\cap C\cap D)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{1}_{ABCD}^{(i)}
\]$$
