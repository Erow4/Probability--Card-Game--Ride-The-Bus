# Probability--Card-Game--Ride-The-Bus

## Rules

*Per ChatGPT*

Ride the Bus is a (drinking) card game played in three phases. In the first phase, each player is dealt four cards one at a time, guessing each card’s property in sequence: red or black, higher or lower than the first card, between or outside the first two cards, and finally the suit. Wrong guesses mean drinks; right guesses in the final round let you assign drinks to others. In phase two, the dealer builds a pyramid of face-down cards (five at the base up to one at the top), flipping them row by row. If a card matches one in your hand, you can play it and assign drinks—the higher the row, the more drinks. Players try to use their cards strategically to avoid being left with too many. In the final phase, the player with the most remaining cards “rides the bus” by guessing card properties in sequence (often starting with red or black) for a set number of cards; any wrong guess forces them to drink and restart from the beginning, making it the most punishing part of the game.
